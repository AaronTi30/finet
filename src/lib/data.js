As a speaker at FINET, I was able to share my skills and experiences with other students and hopefully inspire them. It was a fulfilling experience to be able to contribute to such a valuable purpose. The entire experience, from the planning to the presentation, was truly rewarding.",

Yashvanth reached out to me and I was very impressed with the club and the value it would provide for the members of the club to help students choose their career when it can be overwhelming. I myself had a stressful Grade 11 and 12 and a club like this would have made it a lot easier. The organization of the meeting and the club was done very well and I hope I was able to give some good insights into Industrial Engineering. I wish Yashvanth and his classmate's good luck in their university/career search and future club activities!",
